# Excel-Dashboard-Project
This is an excel file with fake bicycle sales to which a dashboard was created within excel utilizing pivot tables and charts. 
In  thie project you will see the raw sales data such as customer ID, Marital staus, Income, Education, age and If a bicycle was purchased. 
I then utilized this information is 4 pivot tables that break down the information such as male and femal and their associated income. The commute and whether a bicycle was purchased,Age and if a bicycle was purchased. Then I put all of those into charts. 
I then utilized those charts from the pivot tables to create the dashboard and slicing some of the information like marital status, region and education so that the information can be viewed depending the question that might arise. 
For example if you were curious houw many married people from Europe who had a Bachelor's Degree purchased you can narrow down the information in that order and view it on the dashboard charts.
